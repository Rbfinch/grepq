## Usage

Get instructions and examples using `grepq -h`, and `grepq tune -h` and `grepq inverted -h` for more information on the `tune` and `inverted` commands, respectively.

> **Note:**
`grepq` can output to several formats, including those that are gzip or zstd compressed. `grepq`, however, will only accept a FASTQ file or a compressed (gzip or zstd) FASTQ file as the sequence data file. If you get an error message, check that the input data file is a FASTQ file or a gzip or zstd compressed FASTQ file, and that you have specified the correct file format (--read-gzip or --read-zstd for FASTQ files compressed by gzip and zstd, respectively), and file path. Pattern files must contain one regex pattern per line or be provided in JSON format, and patterns are case-sensitive. You can supply an empty pattern file to count the total number of records in the FASTQ file. The regex patterns for matching FASTQ sequences should only include the DNA sequence characters (A, C, G, T), or IUPAC ambiguity codes (N, R, Y, etc.). See `16S-no-iupac.txt`, `16S-iupac.json`, `16S-no-iupac.json`, and `16S-iupac-and-predicates.json` in the `examples` directory for examples of valid pattern files. Regex patterns to match the header field (= record ID line) must comply with the Rust regex library syntax (<https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/#syntax>). If you get an error message, be sure to escape any special characters in the regex pattern.
