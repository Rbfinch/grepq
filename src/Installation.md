## Installation

- From _crates.io_ (easiest method, but will not install the `examples` directory)
  - `cargo install grepq`

- From _source_ (will install the `examples` directory)
  - Clone the repository and `cd` into the `grepq` directory
  - Run `cargo build --release`
  - Relative to the cloned parent directory, the executable will be located in `./target/release`
  - Make sure the executable is in your `PATH` or use the full path to the executable
