## Requirements

- `grepq` has been tested on Linux (x86-64) and macOS (ARM64). It might work on Windows WSL, but it has not been tested.
- Ensure that Rust is installed on your system (<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>)
- If the build fails, make sure you have the latest version of the Rust compiler by running `rustup update`
- To run the `test.sh` and `cookbook.sh` scripts in the `examples` directory, you will need `yq` (v4.44.6 or later), `gunzip` and version 4 or later of `bash`.
